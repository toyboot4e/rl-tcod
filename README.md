# rl-tcod
Yet another hobby project to follow [the revised tutorial](http://rogueliketutorials.com/). Main differences from the original code base are:  

- It is statically type checked via [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy). 
- It uses rich features of the latest Python3, such as @dataclass. 
- It is heavily class-based. 

For object orientation, I followed the [Hauberk](https://github.com/munificent/hauberk) game. 

## Systen Requirements
- Python 3.7 
- [pythontcod](https://github.com/libtcod/python-tcod) 

Just run `pip install tcod` to get pythontcod installed on your computer.
